XOR(^) is used in this problem to find out the missing number.

a ^ b = (a AND ~b) OR (~a AND b)
x ^ 0 = x
x ^ y = y ^ x (Commutativity)
A sequence of XOR operations can remove duplicates without affecting the result.
a ^ b ^ c ^ d ...
Some applications of XOR-
1. Find missing number
2. Swap
3. Find Duplicate Number
4. Find 2 missing/duplicate numbers

u ^ v can be partitioned by the logic that where there is 0, u & v have same bits, and where there is 1, u & v
have different bits.
